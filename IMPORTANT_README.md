# linux_rsync_project
Project on Linux that shows the use of RSYNC command (also combined with Cronjob)

Since, this project solely relies on a video for the viewer to watch (I have uploaded 15 short clips of the main 14 minutes 33 seconds video as Github did not allow me to upload the main file due to its size), I have created a .exe with python that does the following behind the scene:
1.  Downloads the video clips one by one
2.  Merges them into a single video file
3.  Deletes the original downloaded clips

Please follow the steps to be congnizant of the project that I have created:
1.  Only download the mergingApp.exe file
2.  Open the file to start the aforementioned process.

Thank You.
